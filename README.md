## Welcome to KcBrewRon's Pages

Here you'll be able to follow my projects and learn about any status changes to my projects. I'm beginning to learn git and markdown. My company has used subversion so this is all a bit new to me but I feel that it is the way to go to build new and better skills going forward.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kcbrewron/kcbrewron.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
