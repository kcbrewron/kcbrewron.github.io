## Welcome to KcBrewRon's Pages

Here you'll be able to follow my projects and learn about any status changes to my projects. I'm beginning to learn git and markdown. My company has used subversion so this is all a bit new to me but I feel that it is the way to go to build new and better skills going 
forward.

## About Me

I was born and raised in Kansas City and now live in a suburb. I work for a mutual fund firm here in Kansas City where I support internally built apps primarily for integration to vendor systems. My team also maintains our contact center infrastructure. I have been working in IT for the last 7 years learning Java and the Spring Framework while dabbling in python, javascript, and C# .NET. I love to learn new things and am amazed at what the open source community develops every year.
